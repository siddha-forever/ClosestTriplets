Closest Triples
Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, you need to find three integers in the nums array such that their sum is closest to the target. Your task is to implement a function that returns the sum of the three integers.

Return the sum of the three integers.

Example:

INPUT [-1, 2, 1, -4] 1 OUTPUT 2

Exercise-1

Input : 1 2 3 4 1

Output : 6
